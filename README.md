If using macOS, your NeoVim config is located under `~/.config/nvim`.

You'll have to download a [NerdFont](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) in order to display icons correctly. If using iTerm navigate to Settings > Profiles > Your Profile > Text and activate "Use a different font for non-ASCII text". Additionally select a Nerd Font as the Non-ASCII Font.
